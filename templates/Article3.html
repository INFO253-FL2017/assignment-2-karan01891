    <h1 class = "articleheader">How to Develop an Awesome Sense of Direction</h1>
    <h2 class = "articleheader">By Leo Babauta</h2>
    <p>
      It's strange, but I've discovered I have a better sense of direction than many people -- when I travel, it doesn't take<br> that long for me to figure out the lay of the land, and soon I'm walking around almost like a local.<br>
      <br>
      But I've also found out that many other people don't have this good sense of direction, and it can make things difficult<br> for them when they travel to a new place.<br>
      <br>
      I used to think maybe it was something you were born with or not, but I'm now convinced that it's a set of skills you<br> can learn. For me, it always seemed instinctive, until a friend asked me what i do when I get to a new place. I've done<br> a lot of analyzing of what I do since then, and I've broken the skill into a series of steps.<br>
      <br>
      I hope this helps those who feel lost.<br>
      <br>
      Here's what I recommend, whenever you get to a new city or area you're not totally familiar with:<br>
    </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="list1"><strong>First, look at a map for a few minutes.</strong> I will open Google Maps and look at the city and its major landmarks and<br> features. Is there a river, lake, harbor, sea shore? Is there a big central park, or several big parks? Where is the<br> downtown area? What are the major neighborhoods? Major roads? Famous buildings, like the Sydney Opera<br> house? What's to the north or south?<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Walk around a lot.</strong>When I first get to a city, I like to walk around a lot. This is the best way to get to know a city,<br> to wander and start to develop a sense of where things are and how the city looks. But read on to understand<br> how you need to walk around -- it's not just aimless.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Orient to some landmarks.</strong>I like to find a major building, mountain, hill, bridge, that I can keep in view as I walk<br> around. That way when I turn left, I can say, "Oh, the Empire State Building is now over there." This helps me have<br> a point of reference, so I always know where I am relative to that point. Sometimes I have two or more landmarks.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Form a mental map.</strong>This is the key. When you look at a map for a few minutes, then walk around, what you're<br> doing is forming a mental map of the city. At first, it's real vague, but as you walk, you're adding to the map. See<br> how the streets line up in reality compared to how you thought they line up after you first looked at the map.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Look at a map a lot in the beginning, but don't rely on it completely.</strong>As you form your mental map, get in the<br> habit of looking at the paper map in your hand, or the map on your phone, so you can fill in your mental map... but<br>then put away the map and walk without it. Then look at the map again after a little while to fill in your mental map<br> some more. It's a process of learning the map by looking at it every now and then, but not relying on it. If you just<br> follow the map all the time, you don't ever rely on your mental map.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Keep your orientation as you walk around.</strong>When you walk to a destination, or even wander aimlessly, it's easy to<br> forget where you are or what direction you're facing. This is not useful. Instead, if you make a left turn, think, "Oh,<br> now I'm going west," and also remember where your landmark is in relation to where you are. For example, if I<br> start out heading straight for the Eiffel Tower, but then turn left, that means the Eiffel Tower is now on my right.<br> Your mental map should rotate a bit too so you're now facing south instead of west (for example). In this way, you<br> should always know which way to go to get home (to your apartment or hotel).<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Don't just follow someone else or rely on taxis -- figure it out yourself.</strong>One of the biggest mistakes a lot of<br> people make is to just follow their spouse or a guide or let taxis take them places. You will never figure out the lay<br> of the land this way. Instead, figure out how to get places yourself. Yes, you'll make mistakes, but you'll eventually<br> get it. Get lost, then check a map, and figure out how to get where you want to go. It's the only way.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Continually work on your mental map, and test it.</strong>As you walk around, continually update the mental map. Look<br> at the map again, close it, and test out how well you know the city. It's a constant process.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Keep an eye on the names of streets.</strong> I like to look at street names as I walk around. Then I'll look at the street<br> names on a map. Eventually, I get to know which streets head east and west, and<br> which go north and south, and what order they're in.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="list1"><strong>Mark the major streets in your mental map.</strong> Every neighborhood has its major streets, with shopping and<br> restaurants and the like. Get to know where those are, and put them prominently on your mental map. You should<br> get to the point where you can point the direction of these major streets, and even know generally how many<br> blocks to get to them. Same with major parks and marketplaces and water features like rivers. And metro stops.<br> That might seem like a lot, but after awhile, this all becomes second nature. Navigate. Use but don't rely on a<br> map. Walk around a lot, but know where you are when you walk around. Form a mental map and make it better<br> and better as you walk around.<br>
        <br>              
        </li>
      </ol>
        <p>
        I find that people can develop this with practice, and it's also something to teach your kids as you travel. Let them<br> navigate even if it takes a bit longer -- it's a great skill for them to learn. If you have a spouse, take turns navigating so<br> one person doesn't have an underdeveloped sense of direction.<br>
        <br>
        In my experience, this is a key skill for traveling, and it makes every trip so much more fun when you can really figure<br> out a city and start to understand it like a local does. Happy wandering, my friends.<br>
